# Building-Neural-Network-with-Numpy
## Building a Neural Network from scratch using Numpy
## Project Description
### Overview
A neural network is a set of algorithms that aim to recognize the underlying pattern in the data. These are subsets of Machine learning and the heart of deep learning algorithms. Neural networks are inspired by the working of the human brain. 
Neural networks are applied in many real-life applications like self-driving cars, speech recognition, medical diagnosis, and many more.
In this project, I will be building a neural network from scratch just by using NumPy only and not by using any deep learning framework. The built neural network will predict the price of the house in Pune, India. This project will also give us an in-depth idea about the working of neural networks. 
### Aim
- To understand the working of Neural networks
- To build a neural network from scratch using NumPy 



### Data Description
The dataset contains information about the prices of houses based on various attributes. The dataset contains the prices of houses from Pune, Maharashtra(India). 



### Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, sci-kit learn, numpy



### Approach
- Data Preprocessing
- Removing null values
- Scaling numerical features
- One-Hot encoding of categorical data

### Model Training
Training neural network model
 

### Model Evaluation
Evaluation of model on test data
